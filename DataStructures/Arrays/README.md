# Array Data Structure

An array data structure is a fundamental concept in computer science that stores a collection of elements in a contiguous block of memory. It allos for efficient access to elements using indices and is widely used in programming for organizing and manipulating data.

## Types of Array

There are two main types of arrays: 
- One-dimensional
   - These arrays store a single row of elements
- Multidimensional
   - These arrays store multiple rows of elements

## Array Operations

Common operations performed on arrays include: 
- Traversal
   - Visiting each element of an array in a specific order (e.g. sequential, reverse)
- Insertion
   - Adding a new element to an array at a specific index
- Deletion
   - Remvoing an element from an array at a specific index
- Searching
   - Finding the index of an element in an array

## Applications of Array

Arrays are used in a wide variety of applications, including:
- Storing data for processing
- Implementing data structures such as stacks, queues, linked lists, and trees
- Representing data in tables and matrices
