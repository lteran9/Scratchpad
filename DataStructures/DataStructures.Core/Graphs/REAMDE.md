# Graph Data Structure

A graph data structure is a collection of nodes (also called vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes. Graphs are used to represent relationships between entities and are widely used in computer science for modeling networks, social connections, and various other applications.

## Types of Graphs

There are several types of graphs, including:

- Directed Graphs
  - In these graphs, edges have a direction, indicating a one-way relationship between nodes.
- Undirected Graphs
  - In these graphs, edges do not have a direction, indicating a two-way relationship between nodes.
- Weighted Graphs
  - In these graphs, edges have weights or costs associated with them, representing the strength or cost of the connection.
- Unweighted Graphs
  - In these graphs, edges do not have weights, and all connections are considered equal.

## Graph Operations

Common operations performed on graphs include:

- Traversal
  - Visiting each node in a graph using algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).
- Insertion
  - Adding a new node or edge to the graph.
- Deletion
  - Removing a node or edge from the graph.
- Searching
  - Finding a specific node or path between nodes in the graph.

## Applications of Graphs

Graphs are used in a wide variety of applications, including:

- Modeling social networks
- Representing transportation networks
- Analyzing relationships in data
- Implementing algorithms for shortest path and network flow
- Organizing data in databases
- Representing dependencies in project management
- Facilitating recommendation systems
- Visualizing connections in biological networks
- Enhancing search engines through link analysis
- Supporting machine learning algorithms for clustering and classification
- Enabling geographic information systems (GIS) for mapping and spatial analysis
- Optimizing resource allocation in logistics and supply chain management
- Designing circuits and network topologies in computer engineering
- Assisting in natural language processing for semantic analysis
